"""
The sensible nanny that brings sanity to the system! ðŸ‘¶

Introducing oopsie_nanny - the rational layer of our fall detection system.
Like a wise caregiver, it carefully evaluates each alert from oopsie_alert,
asking "Is this really a fall?" before raising the alarm.

Features:
    - Intelligent alert filtering
    - Context-aware decision making
    - Pattern recognition
    - False positive reduction

Because sometimes, not every stumble is a crisis! ðŸ§
