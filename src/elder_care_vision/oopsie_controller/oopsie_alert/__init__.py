"""
The alarm-happy detector that thinks every movement is a crisis! 🚨

Meet oopsie_alert - the overly sensitive component of our fall detection system.
Like an excitable toddler, it triggers on every sneeze, shift, or breeze.
It's the first line of defense, ensuring we never miss a potential fall,
even if it means occasionally crying wolf.

Features:
    - Hyper-sensitive movement detection
    - Immediate alert triggering
    - Comprehensive event logging
    - Configurable sensitivity levels

Remember: It's better to be safe than sorry! 🛡️
